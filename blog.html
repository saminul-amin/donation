          What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web
            documents, particularly HTML. It defines the structure of a webpage
            as a tree of objects, where each tag (such as paragraphs, headers,
            and anchors) is represented as a node in this tree. The DOM allows
            developers to access, modify, add, or delete elements dynamically
            using scripting languages like JavaScript.<br /><br />
            Through the DOM, developers can manipulate the content, structure,
            and style of a webpage without needing to reload the entire page. It
            provides methods to traverse the node tree, making web pages more
            interactive. The DOM is essential for modern web development,
            enabling dynamic updates, event handling, and interaction with user
            inputs.

          How do you select an element from the DOM?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            To select an element from the DOM, you use specific JavaScript
            methods designed for different scenarios. For instance, you can
            select an element by its unique ID, where only one element with that
            ID exists on the page. Alternatively, you can select elements by
            their class name or tag name, which may return multiple elements.
            Another approach is to use CSS-like selectors, where you can target
            an element based on various criteria like its class, tag, or even
            its position in the DOM. Depending on the method, you may get a
            single element or a list of elements. These tools are essential for
            interacting with and manipulating the structure and content of a
            webpage.

          What is event delegation in the context of the DOM, and why is it
          useful?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            Event delegation in the context of the DOM is a technique where a
            single event listener is attached to a parent element rather than
            multiple listeners to individual child elements. When an event (like
            a click) occurs on a child element, it bubbles up to the parent,
            allowing the parent to handle the event for all its children.<br /><br />

            This approach is useful because it improves performance and
            efficiency. Instead of adding separate event listeners to each child
            element (which can be resource-intensive, especially for large lists
            or dynamic content), you only need one listener on the parent. It
            also simplifies code and ensures that even dynamically added child
            elements will be handled without needing new event listeners.

          How do you manipulate an element's attributes and styles using the
          DOM?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            To manipulate an element's attributes and styles using the DOM, you
            can access and modify the element's properties. For attributes, you
            can set or get values like <em>src</em>, <em>href</em>, or
            <em>alt</em> by targeting the specific element and modifying its
            attribute directly. For example, you can change the source of an
            image or the URL of a link.<br /><br />

            For styles, you can access an element's <em>style</em> property and
            assign CSS values directly, such as changing the color, size, or
            visibility of an element. You can also add or remove CSS classes to
            control multiple style changes at once. This approach allows dynamic
            updates to the appearance and behavior of a webpage without
            reloading it, enhancing interactivity and user experience.
